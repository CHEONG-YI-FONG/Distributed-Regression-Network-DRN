# Distributed-Regression-Network-DRN-

**Distribhution Regression Network (DRN)** is a generalized Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that performs regression from input probability distribution to output probability distribution. Performing regression on regression has many applications, such as studying of human population, modeling phenotypic traits evolution and meteorological phenomenon. Traditional methods break down distribution into discrete values or basis function approximation (e.g. Triple Basis Rstimator (3BE)) and feed each values into **multiple** input nodes in a MLP. DRN encodes one entire distribution/function in one **single** node in MLP, significantly reduces the number of parameters needed.
